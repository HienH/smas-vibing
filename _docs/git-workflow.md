# Git Workflow for SMAS
## Feature Branch Development with Manual Integration Testing

**Document Purpose:** Defines the Git workflow for the SMAS project, ensuring code quality through feature branches and manual integration testing before merging to main.

**Last Updated:** June 28, 2025

---

## üéØ Workflow Overview

### Core Principles
- **Feature Branches:** Every new feature/change uses a separate branch
- **Manual Integration:** All changes are manually tested before merging to main
- **Code Review:** Pull requests require review and approval
- **Clean History:** Maintain clean, linear commit history
- **Quality Assurance:** Integration testing ensures everything works together

---

## üåø Branch Strategy

### Main Branch (`main`)
- **Purpose:** Production-ready code only
- **Protection:** Direct pushes disabled, requires pull request
- **Integration:** All features must pass manual integration testing
- **Deployment:** Automatically deploys to production

### Feature Branches (`feature/feature-name`)
- **Purpose:** Development of new features or changes
- **Naming:** `feature/descriptive-feature-name`
- **Lifecycle:** Created from main, merged back via pull request
- **Testing:** Individual feature testing + integration testing

### Hotfix Branches (`hotfix/issue-description`)
- **Purpose:** Critical bug fixes for production
- **Naming:** `hotfix/issue-description`
- **Lifecycle:** Created from main, merged back to main and develop
- **Priority:** High priority, minimal scope

---

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### 1. Starting a New Feature

```bash
# Ensure you're on main and it's up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create and switch to new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Verify you're on the new branch
git branch
```

### 2. Development Process

```bash
# Make your changes
# ... edit files ...

# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication component

- Add login button component
- Implement Spotify OAuth integration
- Add user menu dropdown
- Include proper error handling"

# Push feature branch to remote
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 3. Commit Message Convention

Use conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): implement Spotify OAuth login"
git commit -m "fix(playlist): resolve duplicate song addition issue"
git commit -m "docs(readme): update installation instructions"
```

   # Install dependencies (if needed)
   npm install
   
   # Run tests
   npm run test
   npm run test:integration
   
   # Start development server
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Integration Test Scenarios**

4. **Cross-Browser Testing**
   - [ ] Chrome (latest)
   - [ ] Firefox (latest)
   - [ ] Safari (latest)
   - [ ] Mobile browsers

### Integration Test Results

If integration testing passes:
```bash
# Reset to main (clean state)
git checkout main
git reset --hard origin/main

# Create pull request
# ... create PR on GitHub/GitLab ...
```

If integration testing fails:
```bash
# Reset to main
git checkout main
git reset --hard origin/main

# Fix issues in feature branch
git checkout feature/your-feature-name
# ... fix issues ...
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve integration test failures"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Repeat integration testing
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Branch Protection Rules

### Main Branch Protection

Configure these rules in your Git hosting platform:

- **Require pull request reviews before merging**
  - Required approving reviews: 1
  - Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
  - Require review from code owners

- **Require status checks to pass before merging**
  - Require branches to be up to date before merging
  - Status checks: `test`, `lint`, `build`

- **Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100 MB**
- **Require linear history**
- **Include administrators in these restrictions**

### Feature Branch Guidelines

- **Naming Convention:** `feature/descriptive-name`
- **Maximum Lifetime:** 2 weeks (prevent stale branches)
- **Regular Updates:** Rebase on main weekly
- **Scope:** One feature per branch
